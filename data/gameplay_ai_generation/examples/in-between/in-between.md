### 1. Card Design

* Played with a **standard 52-card deck** (no jokers).
* **Ranks (low → high):** 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A (Ace is always high).
* **Suits don’t matter** for outcomes.
* The game is played with **chips and a central pot**; there are no card point values.

---

### 2. Dealing

* Each player begins with the same number of chips (for example, 10).
* To start a round, **everyone antes 1 chip** into the pot.
* A **dealer** is chosen by each player drawing a card; the highest card makes that player the dealer.
* The player to the dealer’s left takes the first turn.
* Players do not hold hands of cards. Instead, cards are revealed from the central deck during betting.

### 3. Game Round

Play proceeds clockwise. On your turn:

1. **Bet**

   * You may bet any whole number of chips, at least 1 and at most the smaller of your chip total and the pot.
   * If you cannot bet, you must pass.

2. **Reveal and Resolve**

   * If there are no community cards showing, two cards are turned face up as the **community pair**.
   * With these two cards:

     * **Pair (same rank):** You win from the pot an amount up to 2 chips.
     * **Consecutive (ranks differ by 1):** You lose your bet to the pot.
     * **Gap (space between them):** A third card is drawn.

       * If the third card’s rank is **strictly between** the two, you win an amount equal to your bet from the pot.
       * Otherwise, you lose your bet to the pot.

3. **Advance the Round**

   * Play passes clockwise.
   * When the turn comes back around to the dealer, the deal passes to the next player and the community cards are cleared.
   * If the pot becomes empty, all players with chips left must ante 1 to refill it.
   * If any player runs out of chips, the game ends immediately.

### 4. Winning

* The game ends when:

  * The deck runs out of cards needed for play, or
  * A player runs out of chips.
* The winner is the player with the most chips at the end of the game.
