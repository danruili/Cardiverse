    "game_description": "Rank of Cards\n\nThe cards in each suit rank: K (high), Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A.\n\n### The Ante\n\nEach player puts one chip in the pot before each deal.\n\n### The Deal\n\nDeal the cards one at a time face down, beginning with the player on the left. All the cards are dealt, and some players may receive fewer cards than others. It is customary for each player with fewer cards to ante one additional chip.\n\n### Object of the Game\n\nThe goal is to be the first player to get rid of all of their cards.\n\n### The Play\n\nBeginning to the left of the dealer, each person must play a card if possible.\n\nAll cards played remain face up on the table, arranged in four rows of the four suits.\n\nThe plays that may be made are:\n\nAny seven or any card in suit and sequence to a card previously played.\n\nAs the sevens are played, they are placed in a row in the center of the table.\n\nThe sixes are placed in another row to the right - the fives and lower cards in sequence are piled on the sixes.\n\nThe eights are placed on the left of the sevens in their respective suits - nines and higher cards in sequence are piled on the eights.\n\nEach player must play a card during their turn if possible; if the person cannot play, they put one chip in the pot and the turn passes to the left. The game ends when one player gets rid of all of their cards. Each opponent then pays the pot one chip for each card remaining in their hand, and the winner takes the pot.\n\n### Irregularities\n\nIf a player passes when they could have played, the offender must pay three chips into the pot. If the player passed when they were able to play a seven, they must pay an additional five chips to the players holding the six and the eight of the same suit.\n\n### How to Keep Score\n\nOne can play a series of rounds, scoring 1 point for each card each player has remaining at the end of each round. When one player reaches 100 points, the game is over and the player who then has the smallest score is the overall winner.",

A high ratio suggests an aggressive strategy, such as playing more Sixes or Eights to increase sequence potential. Low ratio or low Total Sevens Held indicates a need to preserve key cards until they can best leverage openings into sequences. In scenarios with high Opponent Blocking Potential, players should prioritize placing Eights to obstruct opponents' ability to build upwards. Additionally, players should be mindful of the Chips Potential Loss especially if close to risking significant penalties, adapting their strategy to minimize potential loss and looking for opportunities to safely play without accruing undue risk.
