### 1. Card Design

* Uses a **standard 52-card deck** (no jokers).
* **Ranks & order (per suit):** A (low) through K (high).
* **7s are the starting cards** for each suit.
* Players build outward from each 7 toward **A** on one side and **K** on the other.
* The game is played for **chips**, not card points.

---

### 2. Dealing

* Best with **3–6 players** (4 is ideal).
* The **entire shuffled deck is dealt out** one card at a time.
* Some players may end up with **one card more than others** (depending on the player count).
* Before play begins, all players contribute an **ante of 1 chip** into the pot.
* Any player with fewer cards than the maximum hand pays **1 extra chip** (their ante = 2).

---

### 3. Game Round

Play moves **clockwise**. On a turn, a player must either **play** a card or **pass**.

#### 1. Playing a Card

* A **7 of any suit** may always be played to start that suit’s row.
* To play cards lower than 7 (A–6), the **next higher rank** in that suit must already be on the table.

  * Example: You may only play the 5♣ if the 6♣ is already played.
* To play cards higher than 7 (8–K), the **next lower rank** in that suit must already be on the table.

  * Example: You may only play the 9♦ if the 8♦ is already played.

#### 2. Passing

* If a player cannot play, they must **pass and add 1 chip** to the pot.
* If a player could have played but chooses to pass, they pay an **extra 3 chips** as a penalty.
* If a player holds a **7** and passes, they must pay an additional **5 chips**.

After playing or passing, the turn moves to the next player.

---

### 4. Winning

* The round ends immediately when a player **empties their hand**.
* That player is the **winner**.

#### Scoring & Payoffs

* The **winner collects the pot**, minus their own ante and penalties.
* Each other player **loses the total chips** they contributed during the game.
