Leduc Hold'em is a smaller version of Limit Texas Hold'em (first introduced in Bayes' Bluff: Opponent Modeling in Poker). The deck consists only two pairs of King, Queen and Jack, six cards in total. Each game is fixed with two players, two rounds, two-bet maximum and raise amounts of 2 and 4 in the first and second round. In the first round, one player is randomly choosed to put 1 unit in pot as small blind while the other puts 2 unit as big blind, and each player is dealt one card, then starts betting. The player with small blind acts first. In the second round, one public card is revealed first, then the players bet again. Finally, the player whose hand has the same rank as the public card is the winner. If neither, then the one with higher rank wins. Other rules such as 'fold' can refer to Limit Texas hold'em.
