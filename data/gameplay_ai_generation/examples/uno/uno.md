### 1. Card Design

* **108 cards** total (112 in newer editions).

* Each of 4 colors (red, yellow, green, blue):
  * 1 × **0**
  * 2 × each number **1–9**
  * 2 × **Skip**, **Draw Two**, **Reverse**

* Wild cards:
  * 4 × **Wild**
  * 4 × **Wild Draw Four**

* **Point values for scoring:**
  * Number cards = face value
  * Action cards = 20 points
  * Wild / Wild Draw Four = 50 points

---

### 2. Dealing

* Dealer chosen by drawing highest card.
* Shuffle and deal **7 cards to each player**.
* Place the rest face down → **draw pile**.
* Flip top card to start **discard pile**.
* First player = left of dealer (unless first card is an action card).

---

### 3. Game Round

* **Turn order**: Clockwise (reverses with Reverse card).

* On their turn, a player must:

  1. **Play a card** matching color, number, or symbol on discard pile, OR
  2. **Play a Wild** (declare new color), OR
  3. **Draw a card** (and may immediately play it if valid).

* **Action/Wild Effects:**

  * **Skip** → Next player loses turn.
  * **Reverse** → Order of play switches.
  * **Draw Two (+2)** → Next player draws 2 and loses turn.
  * **Wild** → Player declares new color.
  * **Wild Draw Four (+4)** → Declare color; next player draws 4 and loses turn (can be challenged).

* **Special rules:**

  * **Two-player rule:** Reverse acts like Skip.
  * If draw pile empties → reshuffle discard pile (except top card).

---

### 4. Winning

* **Round ends** when a player goes out (plays last card).

* **Scoring:**
  * Winner earns total points from all opponents’ remaining cards.
