    "game_description": "Many trick-taking games are not directly related to Bridge or Whist. Perhaps the foremost one is Hearts, which is truly one of the greatest card games ever devised for four players, each playing individually.\n\n### The Pack\n\nThe standard 52-card pack is used.\n\nShop Bicycle Hearts Playing Cards\n\n### Object of the Game\n\nTo be the player with the lowest score at the end of the game. When one player hits the agreed-upon score or higher, the game ends; and the player with the lowest score wins.\n\n### Card Values/scoring\n\nAt the end of each hand, players count the number of hearts they have taken as well as the queen of spades, if applicable. Hearts count as one point each and the queen counts 13 points.\n\nEach heart - 1 point\n\nThe Q - 13 points\n\nThe aggregate total of all scores for each hand must be a multiple of 26.\n\nThe game is usually played to 100 points (some play to 50).\n\nWhen a player takes all 13 hearts and the queen of spades in one hand, instead of losing 26 points, that player scores zero and each of his opponents score an additional 26 points.\n\n### The Deal\n\nDeal the cards one at a time, face down, clockwise. In a four-player game, each is dealt 13 cards; in a three-player game, the 2 of diamonds should be removed, and each player gets 17 cards; in a five-player game, the 2 of clubs should be removed so that each player will get 10 cards.\n\n### The Play\n\nThe player holding the 2 of clubs after the pass makes the opening lead. If the 2 has been removed for the three handed game, then the 3 of clubs is led.\n\nEach player must follow suit if possible. If a player is void of the suit led, a card of any other suit may be discarded. However, if a player has no clubs when the first trick is led, a heart or the queen of spades cannot be discarded. The highest card of the suit led wins a trick and the winner of that trick leads next. There is no trump suit.\n\nThe winner of the trick collects it and places it face down. Hearts may not be led until a heart or the queen of spades has been discarded. The queen does not have to be discarded at the first opportunity.\n\nThe queen can be led at any time.",
    "game_actions": "1. Lead a trick with the 2 of clubs if held (or the 3 of clubs if playing with three players and the 2 has been removed).\n2. Follow suit if possible when a card is led in a trick.\n3. Discard a card from a different suit if void in the suit led, except for a heart or the queen of spades on the first trick.\n4. Win a trick by playing the highest card of the suit led.\n5. Lead the next trick if the previous trick was won.\n6. Lead a heart or the queen of spades only after a heart or the queen of spades has already been discarded in the round.\n7. Lead the queen of spades at any time if desired.\n8. Collect won tricks and keep them face down for scoring at the end of the round.",
    "singular_strategy": "{\"name\":\"Early Game Defense and Control\",\"description\":\"Focus on playing lower value cards during the early rounds to avoid winning tricks that might contain penalty cards such as hearts or the queen of spades.

If voiding isn't possible, try to maintain control by following suit with the lowest card, reducing the chance of winning undesirable tricks.\",\"reason\":\"Leading with lower cards and attempting to void suits grants better control over future rounds. By voiding a suit, the AI can offload high-risk cards like hearts or the queen of spades when forced to follow a different suit.

        "Avoid Taking Points": "{\"name\":\"Refined Strategy for Avoiding Points\",\"reflection1\":\"The original strategy mentioned playing low cards whenever possible to avoid taking points. However, it did not define 'whenever possible', leaving the player without clear guidance during ambiguous situations mid-game.\",\"reflection2\":\"The strategy should be conditioned on game state metrics such as 'Risk of Taking Heart' and 'Suit Shortage'. These metrics help determine the safest action by assessing the potential risks and assess the current advantages or disadvantages based on the remaining cards and the game's progression.\",\"content\":\"To implement the refined strategy effectively, the player should continuously evaluate the Risk of Taking Heart metric. If the risk is high, focus on discarding higher cards of other suits when void in the leading suit, and avoid playing into opponents\u2019 strengths. To prevent taking the Queen of Spades, track the play history and anticipate likely occurrences. If conditions appear favorable and the Potential for Shooting the Moon is surprisingly possible, consider temporarily collecting hearts or the queen to capitalize on this rare strategic opportunity. Additionally, monitor Suit Shortage to create opportunities for controlled disposals that avoid penalty points, and use Control of the Lead wisely to steer gameplay away from unfavorable suit situations by forcing opponents into difficult plays.\"}",
        "Shoot the Moon": "{\"name\":\"Shoot the Moon Strategy Refined\",\"reflection1\":\"The original strategy is quite clear in its goal to win all the hearts and the queen of spades, but lacks clarity on what the 'critical moments' are for playing certain cards. Specifically, it should mention: a) When to start winning tricks aggressively to gather hearts and the queen, and b) When to deliberately lose a trick to avoid unknowingly conceding points if the moon shot becomes unviable.\",\"reflection2\":\"The strategy should be conditioned on a set of metrics, particularly 'Potential for Shooting the Moon'. For example, the strategy should assess if the hand composition and the play history suggest a viable path to shooting the moon. 'Control of the Lead' is also crucial; having the initiative allows targeting specific cards for capture or avoidance. Early rounds should boost chances for shaping hands favorably while evading heart penalties.\",\"content\":\"To successfully shoot the moon, ensure that you have a strong initial hand, preferably with high-ranking cards in each suit, particularly in hearts and spades. Monitor the 'Potential for Shooting the Moon' metric closely by considering whether you can collect all hearts and the queen based on the game state. Be mindful of the 'Control of the Lead' metric; gaining lead control early may allow you to set the pace and dictate the action. Under 'Suit Shortage', exploit suits where you are strong and opponents are likely weak, helping capture necessary tricks. A critical moment to act is notably when no hearts or the queen have been played, suggesting safely leveraging your strong cards while angling to collect hearts later. If opposition makes collecting all penalty cards impossible, abort the moonshot promptly\u2014lower the 'Risk of Taking Heart' by playing safer strategies to avoid high-value tricks.\"}",
        "Pass High Cards Strategically": "{\"name\":\"Pass High Cards Strategically\",\"reflection1\":\"The strategy mentions passing high cards strategically without specifying what conditions make passing them strategic. To clarify, critical moments for passing high cards include situations where the player has many high cards in a suit with insufficient low cards to avoid winning tricks. Pass high-value cards in suits where you're unsupported by lower-value cards, especially in suits like spades before the queen is discarded.\",\"reflection2\":\"To condition this strategy on game state, consider the following: 1) Risk of Taking Heart - Pass high cards primarily from suits where opponents might lead, increasing the chances of unnecessarily winning hearts. 2) Potential for Shooting the Moon - If shooting the moon seems feasible (holding most high cards across suits), consider keeping high cards and aim to take all tricks. 3) Control of the Lead - If you already possess the lead or expect not to lead initially, passing high cards can prevent accidentally taking the lead. 4) Suit Shortage - Focus on passing high cards from suits where you lack shortages, as voids help later to control unwanted trick wins.\",\"content\":\"To effectively 'Pass High Cards Strategically,' ensure that high cards are passed from suits where they are not supported by many low cards. Consider the current game state: focus on suits where having high cards would result in unwanted trick wins. When the risk of taking hearts or the queen of spades is significant, pass high cards from those suits. If shooting the moon is possible, adjust your strategy to retain high cards. Additionally, consider your control over the lead; if you're likely to lead, passing high cards helps avoid risky tricks. Finally, use your suit shortage to your advantage, and pass high cards from suits where you aren't close to voiding, as voiding provides more discarding opportunities.\"}",
        "Lead Strong Suits Late in the Game": "{\"name\":\"Refined Strong Suits Strategy\",\"reflection1\":\"The initial strategy mentions 'late in the game' and 'strategic plays' which may be vague for players. It is necessary to specify what constitutes the late phase of the game and under which conditions the strategy becomes crucial.\",\"reflection2\":\"The strategy should consider relevant game state metrics to determine the optimal timing for employing the strategy of leading strong suits. It should define the measurable conditions under which the player should start to lead with their strongest suit.\",\"content\":\"Refinement of the strategy involves firstly defining 'late in the game' as when a majority of hearts have already been played and the queen of spades has either been played or is likely to be played soon. Strategic plays become necessary when the Risk of Taking Heart is low for the player and high for opponents, providing a favorable scenario. The strategy conditions on: (1) 'Risk of Taking Heart' being low for the AI player, meaning few hearts or the queen remain with opponents. (2) 'Control of the Lead' metric is high for the AI, allowing it to dictate the choice of suit to play strategically. (3) Observation that opponents are likely to hold high-value cards or penalty cards from remaining play history. Under these states, the player should lead their strongest suits to maximize control over the game and influence opponents negatively by forcing them to play high or unfavorable cards.\"}"
