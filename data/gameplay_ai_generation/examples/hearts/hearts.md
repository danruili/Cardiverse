### 1. Card Design

* Uses a **standard 52-card deck** (no jokers).
* Ranks per suit: 2–10, J, Q, K, A.
* To make hands even:

  * With **3 players**, the **2♦** is removed.
  * With **5 players**, the **2♣** is removed.
* **Point cards (penalties):**

  * Each **Heart** = **1 point**
  * **Queen of Spades (Q♠)** = **13 points**
  * All other cards = **0 points**

---

### 2. Dealing

* Supported player counts: **3, 4, or 5** (recommended: 4).
* Cards per player:

  * **3 players** → 17 each
  * **4 players** → 13 each
  * **5 players** → 10 each
* All cards are dealt. There is **no stock pile** or **discard pile**.
* The first lead is determined by who holds the **2♣**. If that card was removed, the **3♣** or another fallback starts instead.

---

### 3. Game Round

* Play moves **clockwise**. Each turn is a **trick**:

  1. **Lead a card**

     * The very first trick must begin with the **2♣** (or the next-lowest Club if absent).
     * Hearts cannot be led until they are “broken” (when a Heart or the Queen of Spades has been played at any point).

  2. **Follow suit**

     * Players must follow the suit led if they can.
     * If they cannot, they may play any card, including Hearts or the Queen of Spades.

  3. **Winning the trick**

     * The highest card of the suit led wins the trick (Ace high).
     * The winner collects the trick and leads the next one.

---

### 4. Winning

* A **round ends** when all players’ hands are empty.
* **Scoring for each round:**

  * Each Heart taken = **1 penalty point**
  * Queen of Spades = **13 penalty points**
* **Special case – Shooting the Moon:**

  * If one player takes **all 26 penalty points**, the scores are flipped so that player benefits and the others are penalized.
* **Game end:**

  * Once the round finishes, scores are tallied.
  * Final outcome is based on comparing scores—lower is better.
