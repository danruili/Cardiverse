### 1. Card Design

* Uses a **standard 52-card deck** (no jokers).
* **Card values** (for scoring and trick resolution):

  * **2–10 = face value**
  * **J, Q, K = 10**
  * **Ace = 1**
* **Lead suit matters:** only cards of the **lead suit** can win a trick.
* **Rank matching** is allowed if you can’t follow suit, but those cards cannot win the trick unless they also happen to be of the lead suit.

### 2. Dealing

* Works with **2–4 players** (best at **4**).
* Each player is dealt **7 cards**.
* The rest form a **stock pile** (face down).
* The first player simply **leads** with any card; there is no face-up starter card.

---

### 3. Game Round

Play moves **clockwise**. On a player’s turn:

1. **Play a Card**

   * If you’re leading a trick, you may play **any card**.
   * If not, you must **follow the lead suit** or play a card of the **same rank** as the lead card (any suit).

2. **If You Cannot Play**

   * Draw **one card** from the stock.
   * If the stock is empty and you still cannot play, you must **pass**.
   * After drawing, your turn ends immediately—you don’t play that card until your next turn.

3. **Resolving the Trick**

   * A trick ends once each player has played **one card**.
   * The winner is the player with the **highest-value card of the lead suit**.
   * That player collects the trick and **leads the next round**.
   * If the stock is empty and all players must pass, any trick in progress is resolved as is, and the leader continues for the next round.

---

### 4. Winning

* The game ends when a player **empties their hand** by playing their last card.
* The other players then total the **value of the cards left in their hands**:

  * **2–10 = face value**
  * **J, Q, K = 10**
  * **Ace = 1**
* The winner scores the sum of those values, while each opponent scores a negative equal to their hand total.
