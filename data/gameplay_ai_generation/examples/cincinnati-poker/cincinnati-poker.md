### 1. Card Design

* Uses a **standard 52-card deck** (no jokers).
* **Poker hand rankings** determine the winner at showdown:

  * Straight Flush (highest), Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush, Straight, Three of a Kind, Two Pair, One Pair, High Card (lowest).
* Aces play as **high cards**.

---

### 2. Dealing

* Played with **2–6 players** (best with 4).
* Each player receives **5 private cards**.
* **Five community cards** are placed face down on the table.
* Every player begins with the same number of **chips** (for betting).

---

### 3. Game Round

* Play moves **clockwise**, with each player taking one action per turn.
* **Possible actions**:

  * **Check** – stay in without betting, if no bet is active.
  * **Bet** – put chips into the pot to start the action.
  * **Call** – match the current bet to stay in.
  * **Raise** – increase the bet.
  * **Fold** – drop out of the hand and forfeit any claim to the pot.
* A betting round ends when all active players have either matched the highest bet or folded.
* At the end of each betting round, **one community card** is turned face up.
* Betting rounds continue until all **five community cards** are revealed, unless only one player remains.
* If all but one player folds, that player **wins the pot immediately**.

---

### 4. Winning

* A hand ends when:

  * Only one player remains after others fold (instant win), **or**
  * All five community cards are revealed and betting ends (showdown).
* At **showdown**, each remaining player makes the best possible hand using their **five private cards plus the revealed community cards**.
* The **strongest hand wins the pot**; if two or more players tie, the pot is **split evenly**.
