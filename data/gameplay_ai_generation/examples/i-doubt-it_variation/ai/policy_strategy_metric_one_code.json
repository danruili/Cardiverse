        "**Suit Diversity Score**\nMeasures the number of unique suits in the AI player's hand. A higher value indicates a stronger potential for gem collection and endgame scoring. This metric is crucial in determining actions that maintain or enhance suit diversity.\n**Declared Rank Confidence**\nRepresents the confidence level in a declared rank during the Accumulation phase based on the AI's hand and historical challenges. A higher score suggests a safer declaration, decreasing the risk of being challenged.\n**Alliance Potential Value**\nEvaluates the strategic value and potential benefits of forming an alliance with specific players based on current game state and historical player behavior. This metric informs the decision to seek alliances in Phase 2.\n**Challenge Risk Assessment**\nCalculates the probability of a successful challenge against another player's declaration, based on known game state data and historical accuracy of other players' declarations. A higher score indicates a higher likelihood of successfully challenging an opponent.\n**Bluff with Lower Cards**\nIn Phase 1, declare a high-ranking card while placing lower cards face down. This tactic can discourage opponents from challenging and help deplete low-value cards from your hand.\n**Strategic Alliances**\nIn Phase 2, form alliances with players who have complementary objectives. Use the alliance to strategically exchange cards and influence decision-making to your advantage.\n**Suit Maximization for Gems**\nIn Phase 3, focus on diversifying your suits to maximize gem collection. Use gems to activate abilities that can change turn sequences or nullify threats.\n**Timing of Challenges**\nDevelop a keen sense of when to challenge in Phase 1. Observing opponents' patterns and behaviors can provide insight into their bluffs, allowing you to make calculated challenges."
