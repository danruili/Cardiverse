    "game_description": "### The Pack\n\nThe standard 52-card pack is used.\n\n### Object of the Game\n\nThe player who lingers longer than the rest and is the last player holding cards is the winner.\n\n### The Deal\n\nEach player receives as many cards as there are players in the game. For example, if there are five players, each player gets five cards.\n\nThe dealer shuffles the cards and deals them one at a time face down to the players. The remaining cards are placed in a stack in the center of the players. This stack becomes the stock.\n\nOnce all players have their cards, the dealer takes the last card they dealt to themselves and turns it over, showing all the other players, then places it back into their hand. The card shown is the trump suit for the game.\n\n### The Play\n\nThe player directly to the left of the dealer goes first, putting any card in the trump suit in the middle of the table. If a trump card cannot be played, the player can play any card in his hand.\n\nThe next player goes by playing the suit or a trump card. You are trying to win the trick, so play the highest ranking card possible.\n\nPlay continues to the left until every player has played their card.\n\nWhichever player played the highest card or highest trump card, if a trump card was played, wins the trick. The cards from the finished trick are placed to the side and the winner of the trick takes the top card from the stock adding it to their hand. The winner then plays the first card starting the next trick.\n\nIf at any time during the game a player runs out of cards, they immediately withdraw from the game",

The strategy also considers Stock Size Impact - if the stock is large, use trump cards to win tricks and draw more cards. Conversely, if the stock is depleting, conserve trump cards for assurance of winning critical remaining tricks.

Specifically, if an opponent repeatedly avoids playing a particular suit, the AI can deduce that this opponent has few or none of those cards and adjust its risk-taking with its own cards accordingly. Additionally, the AI can prioritize playing higher-ranking cards in suits the opponent likely lacks to attempt to win tricks more confidently.

A critical moment to play such high cards is when the 'Trick Winning Probability' suggests a high chance of securing the trick by playing the high non-trump card.

(3) Consider 'Stock Size Impact' and adjust drawing strategies: focus on aggressive drawing for quality when stock size is ample, and conserve powerful plays when stock is nearly depleted.
