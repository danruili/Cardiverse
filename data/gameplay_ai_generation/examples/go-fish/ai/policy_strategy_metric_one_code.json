    "game_description": "Go Fish is a fun game that will amuse and entertain even the youngest card players. It is similar to the game Authors.\n\n### The Pack\n\nThe standard 52-card pack is used. Some cards will be dealt and the rest will form the stock pile.\n\nShop our Hoyle 6 in 1 Fun Pack\n\n### Object of the Game\n\nThe goal is to win the most \"books\" of cards. A book is any four of a kind, such as four kings, four aces, and so on.\n\n### Rank of Cards\n\nThe cards rank from ace (high) to two (low). The suits are not important, only the card numbers are relevant, such as two 3s, two 10s, and so on.\n\n### The Deal\n\nAny player deals one card face up to each player. The player with the lowest card is the dealer. The dealer shuffles the cards, and the player to the right cuts them.\n\nThe dealer completes the cut and deals the cards clockwise one at a time, face down, beginning with the player to the left. If two or three people are playing, each player receives seven cards. If four or five people are playing, each receives five cards. The remainder of the pack is placed face down on the table to form the stock.\n\n### The Play\n\nThe player to the left of the dealer looks directly at any opponent and says, for example, \"Give me your kings,\" usually addressing the opponent by name and specifying the rank that they want, from ace down to two. The player who is \"fishing \u201cmust have at least one card of the rank that was asked for in their hand. The player who is addressed must hand over all the cards requested. If the player has none, they say, \"Go fish!\" and the player who made the request draws the top card of the stock and places it in their hand.\n\nIf a player gets one or more cards of the named rank that was asked for, they are entitled to ask the same or another player for a card. The player can ask for the same card or a different one. So long as the player succeeds in getting cards (makes a catch), their turn continues. When a player makes a catch, they must reveal the card so that the catch is verified. If a player gets the fourth card of a book, the player shows all four cards, places them on the table face up in front of everyone, and plays again.\n\nIf the player goes fishing without \"making a catch\" (does not receive a card he asked for), the turn passes to the left.\n\nThe game ends when all thirteen books have been won. The winner is the player with the most books. During the game, if a player is left without cards, they may (when it's their turn to play), draw from the stock and then ask for cards of that rank. If there are no cards left in the stock, they are out of the game.",

        "**Potential Book Completion**\nMeasures the likelihood of completing a book based on current hand and previously requested cards. Calculated as the number of cards of a specific rank the player has plus the known whereabouts of other cards of the same rank based on history.\n**Opponent Vulnerability Index**\nEvaluates the likelihood an opponent has cards of a needed rank. This is influenced by previous interactions, such as whether the opponent asked for or supplied a card of this rank, and the general flow of cards across players.\n**Stock Dependency**\nAssesses the importance or risk of going fishing (drawing from stock) based on the player's current hand composition and stock size. A higher metric value indicates a greater reliance on drawing to complete books because of few opportunities to ask effectively.\n**Turn Continuation Probability**\nEstimates the chance of maintaining the turn after asking for a card, which combines the likelihood of making a successful request with the number of potential books that could emerge from a successful card receipt. This metric helps prioritize asking actions to balance book formation and prolonging turns.\n**Memory Tracking**\nKeep track of all requests and responses involving ranks including opponent responses of 'Go Fish'. Use this information to deduce potential cards in opponents' hands and avoid redundant requests.\n**Priority on Completing Books**\nFocus on asking for cards of ranks that the AI has multiple cards of in its hand, prioritizing those with three cards first, then two.\n**Opponent Weakness Exploitation**\nIdentify opponents who appear to be low in cards or targeted by other players frequently and focus on them for requests, as they might have fewer options to respond with a 'Go Fish\u2019.\n**Balanced Stock Utilization**\nWhen drawing from the stock, balance picks by assessing game history and adjusting probability estimations of completing books, drawing cards that make completing books more probable."
