    "game_description": "Go Fish is a fun game that will amuse and entertain even the youngest card players. It is similar to the game Authors.\n\n### The Pack\n\nThe standard 52-card pack is used. Some cards will be dealt and the rest will form the stock pile.\n\nShop our Hoyle 6 in 1 Fun Pack\n\n### Object of the Game\n\nThe goal is to win the most \"books\" of cards. A book is any four of a kind, such as four kings, four aces, and so on.\n\n### Rank of Cards\n\nThe cards rank from ace (high) to two (low). The suits are not important, only the card numbers are relevant, such as two 3s, two 10s, and so on.\n\n### The Deal\n\nAny player deals one card face up to each player. The player with the lowest card is the dealer. The dealer shuffles the cards, and the player to the right cuts them.\n\nThe dealer completes the cut and deals the cards clockwise one at a time, face down, beginning with the player to the left. If two or three people are playing, each player receives seven cards. If four or five people are playing, each receives five cards. The remainder of the pack is placed face down on the table to form the stock.\n\n### The Play\n\nThe player to the left of the dealer looks directly at any opponent and says, for example, \"Give me your kings,\" usually addressing the opponent by name and specifying the rank that they want, from ace down to two. The player who is \"fishing \u201cmust have at least one card of the rank that was asked for in their hand. The player who is addressed must hand over all the cards requested. If the player has none, they say, \"Go fish!\" and the player who made the request draws the top card of the stock and places it in their hand.\n\nIf a player gets one or more cards of the named rank that was asked for, they are entitled to ask the same or another player for a card. The player can ask for the same card or a different one. So long as the player succeeds in getting cards (makes a catch), their turn continues. When a player makes a catch, they must reveal the card so that the catch is verified. If a player gets the fourth card of a book, the player shows all four cards, places them on the table face up in front of everyone, and plays again.\n\nIf the player goes fishing without \"making a catch\" (does not receive a card he asked for), the turn passes to the left.\n\nThe game ends when all thirteen books have been won. The winner is the player with the most books. During the game, if a player is left without cards, they may (when it's their turn to play), draw from the stock and then ask for cards of that rank. If there are no cards left in the stock, they are out of the game.",

Continue to ask the same or another player for cards if a successful catch is made (receiving one or more asked-for cards).\n5.

During a turn, the AI should also consider Opponent Vulnerability Index, asking opponents previously known to hold or request cards of those ranks, thus increasing the success rate of requests.

This involves tracking their requests and responses. If Opponent Vulnerability Index is low, shift focus to drawing from the stock.\\n\\n3. **Determine Stock Dependency**: If you have a high dependency on the stock due to lacking synergies in your hand, prioritize ranks where drawing a card could complete a book or provide the ability to ask effectively in future turns.\\n\\n4. **Calculate Turn Continuation Probability**: Use this to decide whether it's more advantageous to fish directly from the stock or continue asking players where the chance of prolonging your turn is higher.
