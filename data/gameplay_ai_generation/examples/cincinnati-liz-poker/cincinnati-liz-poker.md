### 4. Betting Actions

On your turn, you may be able to:

* **Check** – pass without betting (only if you’re not behind).
* **Bet** – if no one has bet yet, you may open the betting with a small wager.
* **Call** – match the current highest bet.
* **Raise** – increase the current highest bet.
* **Fold** – drop out of the hand, surrendering any chips you’ve put in.

---

### 5. Betting Rounds & Reveals

* Play moves clockwise.
* A betting round ends when all active players have either matched the highest bet or folded.
* After each betting round, **reveal one of the community cards**.
* Betting then restarts.
* Continue until all **five community cards** are revealed.

---

### 6. The Wild Card

* The **third community card revealed** becomes the **wild card** for the hand.
* That **specific card** can be treated as **any rank and suit** to complete a player’s best 5-card hand.
* Because of this, **Five of a Kind** is a valid winning hand.

---

### 7. Showdown & Winning

* If all but one player folds, the last player wins the pot immediately.
* If more than one player remains after all five community cards are revealed, everyone shows their best 5-card hand.
* The **highest-ranked hand** wins the pot.
* If there is a tie, the tied players split the pot evenly.
