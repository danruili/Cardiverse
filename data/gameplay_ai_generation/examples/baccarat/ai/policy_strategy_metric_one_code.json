    "game_description": "Perhaps the most glamorous of all casino games, Baccarat's trappings are what made it so popular. The lure of the game? It requires no skill - it is a game of pure luck! Baccarat is played for very high stakes, and the gaming table for it is placed in a special alcove, blocked off from the masses and the rest of the casino action. In American casinos, Baccarat tends to be played with real cash - $100-bills are spread all around. European casinos use chips, but the high-denomination chips are oblong \"plaques,\" which make the game look just as exciting as the American version when they are stacked in front of a winning player.\n\n### The Pack\n\nEight 52-card packs are shuffled together and dealt by the croupier (dealer) from a dealing box, called a shoe, which releases one card at a time, face down. In some games, six packs are used.\n\n### The Layout\n\nThe very large Baccarat table has 12 seats, six on either side of the dealer, who only banks the game and does not otherwise participate. Green felt covers the entire table, and the numbers 1 to 12 are marked on it. These numbered areas are where the players keep their money (or chips, as the case may be). A player may bet on the Bank or the Player, and the layout indicates where such bets are placed.\n\nBaccarat is known in some areas as Punto Banco. The only difference is that the word \"Bank\" is replaced by \"Banco,\" and the word \"Player\" is replaced by \"Punto.\" While in most casino games, the dealer stands, in Baccarat, the dealer is seated between players \"1\" and \"12.\"",

        "**Win Probability Difference**\nThe difference in the estimated probability of winning between betting on the Bank (Banco) and the Player (Punto). This metric helps assess the potential value of each betting option based on historical outcomes and odds.\n**Betting History Influence**\nA statistical measure of the past outcomes for Bank and Player bets. It evaluates streaks or patterns in recent rounds to determine if there appears to be any influence in outcomes, despite the nature of the game being luck-based.\n**Bank Edge**\nThe built-in mathematical house advantage (edge) for Bank bets. This measures the long-term expected return from consistently betting on Bank compared to Player, which typically has a slightly better edge in most versions of Baccarat.\n**Card Counting Impact**\nA calculated effect based on the cards dealt so far, factoring in any changes to standard odds if certain high-impact cards (like aces or face cards) are more or less likely to appear in forthcoming rounds.\n**Consistent Bank Bet**\nAlways place a bet on the Bank (Banco) area for each round of Baccarat.\n**Card Counting Awareness**\nTrack the cards that have been dealt to gauge when to bet on the Player (Punto) or Bank (Banco).\n**Trend Betting Strategy**\nObserve trends in the game for streaks or patterns to decide when to bet on the Player or Bank.\n**Martingale System**\nUse the Martingale betting system which involves doubling the bet after every loss."
