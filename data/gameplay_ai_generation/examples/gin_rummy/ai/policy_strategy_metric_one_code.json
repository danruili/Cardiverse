    "game_description": "This document outlines the rules for the card game Gin Rummy, as implemented in the provided code.\n\n### 1. Game Objective\n\nThe primary goal in Gin Rummy is to form a hand where most or all of your cards are part of valid combinations called **melds**. By doing so, you aim to reduce the value of your unmatched cards, known as **deadwood**, to a minimum. A player can win a round by \"going Gin\" (having a hand with zero deadwood) or by \"knocking\" with a low deadwood count.\n\n### 2. Game Setup\n\n* **Players:** The game is designed for two players.\n* **Deck:** A standard 52-card deck is used.\n* **Dealing:**\n    * One player is designated as the dealer.\n    * The non-dealer is dealt 11 cards, and the dealer receives 10 cards.\n    * The remaining cards form the **stock pile**, which is placed face down. The top card of the stock pile is turned face up to start the **discard pile**.\n\n### 3. Gameplay\n\nThe game proceeds in turns, starting with the non-dealer. A player's turn consists of two main actions: a **draw** and a **discard**.\n\n#### 3.1. The Draw\n\nAt the beginning of your turn, you must take one card from either:\n\n* The **stock pile** (the face-down deck).\n* The **discard pile** (the face-up pile of discarded cards). You may only take the top card of the discard pile.\n\n#### 3.2. The Discard\n\nAfter drawing a card, you will have 11 cards in your hand. You must then choose one card to discard, placing it face up on top of the discard pile.\n\n### 4. Melds\n\nA **meld** is a combination of cards in your hand that helps to reduce your deadwood score. There are two types of melds:\n\n* **Set:** Three or four cards of the same rank (e.g., 7 of Hearts, 7 of Clubs, 7 of Spades).\n* **Run:** Three or more cards of the same suit in sequential order (e.g., 4 of Diamonds, 5 of Diamonds, 6 of Diamonds). Aces are always low in a run (e.g., Ace-2-3 is a valid run, but Queen-King-Ace is not).\n\nA single card cannot belong to more than one meld at the same time.\n\n### 5. Card Values (Deadwood)\n\nThe point values of the cards are as follows:\n\n* **Ace:** 1 point\n* **Number Cards (2-9):** Face value (e.g., a 5 is worth 5 points)\n* **Face Cards (10, Jack, Queen, King):** 10 points each\n\nThe **deadwood count** is the total point value of all the cards in your hand that are not part of a valid meld.\n\n### 6. Ending a Round\n\nThere are three ways a round can end:\n\n#### 6.1. Going Gin\n\nIf, after drawing a card, you can form melds with all 10 of your cards (leaving you with a deadwood count of zero), you can \"go Gin.\" You would discard your 11th card and declare \"Gin.\"\n\n* **Scoring for Gin:** You receive a bonus of 25 points, plus the total deadwood count of your opponent's hand.\n\n#### 6.2. Knocking\n\nIf your deadwood count is 10 or less after drawing a card, you may choose to \"knock.\" To do this, you discard your 11th card and lay down your hand, separating your melds from your deadwood.\n\n* **Lay-offs:** The opponent then has the opportunity to \"lay off\" any of their own deadwood cards that can be added to your melds. For example, if you have a meld of three Kings, and your opponent has the fourth King, they can lay it off. If you have a run of 5-6-7 of Hearts, they can lay off the 4 of Hearts or the 8 of Hearts.\n* **Scoring for Knocking:**\n    * **If your deadwood count is lower than your opponent's (after they have laid off their cards):** You score the difference between your deadwood and their remaining deadwood.\n    * **Undercutting:** If your opponent, after laying off cards, has a deadwood count that is less than or equal to yours, they have \"undercut\" you. In this case, the opponent scores a 25-point bonus, plus the difference in your deadwood counts.\n\n#### 6.3. Dead Hand\n\nIf the stock pile is reduced to only two cards and no player has knocked or gone Gin, the round is declared a \"dead hand,\" and no points are awarded to either player.\n\n",

    "policy_list": [
        "**Potential Meld Completion**\nMeasures the likelihood of completing or extending a meld by drawing a specific card from the discard pile or stock pile. Higher scores are given to moves that contribute to forming or improving existing melds.\n**Deadwood Reduction Potential**\nQuantifies how a potential move (draw or discard) affects the total deadwood count in the player's hand. Actions that greatly reduce deadwood are favored.\n**Knocking Potential**\nEstimates the ability to knock after a draw, either immediately or in future turns by evaluating potential routes to achieve a deadwood count of 10 or less. Prioritizes actions that would lead to a quick shortcut to knock.\n**Opponent Meld Disruption Potential**\nAssesses the strategy of choosing discard cards that could deny or delay the opponent's ability to complete melds, particularly if knowledge can be inferred about their possible meld strategies from the discard history.\n**Prioritize Building Melds**\nFocus on forming sets and runs early in the game to minimize deadwood quickly. Evaluate your hand to recognize potential combinations and avoid discarding cards that could complete a meld.\n**Smart Discarding**\nDiscard cards that are unlikely to form melds and are less likely to be useful to your opponent. Pay attention to the cards your opponent is picking up from the discard pile to infer their strategy and avoid assisting them.\n**Calculative Drawing**\nDecide whether to draw from the discard pile based on your current hand composition and the potential to use the top discard card in a meld. Draw from the stock pile if the discard pile does not offer immediate benefits.\n**Timely Knocking**\nOpt to knock when your deadwood count is low enough, preferably immediately when it reaches 10 or less, to limit the opponent's lay-off opportunities and maximize the scoring differential."
