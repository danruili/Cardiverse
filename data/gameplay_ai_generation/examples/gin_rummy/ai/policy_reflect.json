    "game_description": "This document outlines the rules for the card game Gin Rummy, as implemented in the provided code.\n\n### 1. Game Objective\n\nThe primary goal in Gin Rummy is to form a hand where most or all of your cards are part of valid combinations called **melds**. By doing so, you aim to reduce the value of your unmatched cards, known as **deadwood**, to a minimum. A player can win a round by \"going Gin\" (having a hand with zero deadwood) or by \"knocking\" with a low deadwood count.\n\n### 2. Game Setup\n\n* **Players:** The game is designed for two players.\n* **Deck:** A standard 52-card deck is used.\n* **Dealing:**\n    * One player is designated as the dealer.\n    * The non-dealer is dealt 11 cards, and the dealer receives 10 cards.\n    * The remaining cards form the **stock pile**, which is placed face down. The top card of the stock pile is turned face up to start the **discard pile**.\n\n### 3. Gameplay\n\nThe game proceeds in turns, starting with the non-dealer. A player's turn consists of two main actions: a **draw** and a **discard**.\n\n#### 3.1. The Draw\n\nAt the beginning of your turn, you must take one card from either:\n\n* The **stock pile** (the face-down deck).\n* The **discard pile** (the face-up pile of discarded cards). You may only take the top card of the discard pile.\n\n#### 3.2. The Discard\n\nAfter drawing a card, you will have 11 cards in your hand. You must then choose one card to discard, placing it face up on top of the discard pile.\n\n### 4. Melds\n\nA **meld** is a combination of cards in your hand that helps to reduce your deadwood score. There are two types of melds:\n\n* **Set:** Three or four cards of the same rank (e.g., 7 of Hearts, 7 of Clubs, 7 of Spades).\n* **Run:** Three or more cards of the same suit in sequential order (e.g., 4 of Diamonds, 5 of Diamonds, 6 of Diamonds). Aces are always low in a run (e.g., Ace-2-3 is a valid run, but Queen-King-Ace is not).\n\nA single card cannot belong to more than one meld at the same time.\n\n### 5. Card Values (Deadwood)\n\nThe point values of the cards are as follows:\n\n* **Ace:** 1 point\n* **Number Cards (2-9):** Face value (e.g., a 5 is worth 5 points)\n* **Face Cards (10, Jack, Queen, King):** 10 points each\n\nThe **deadwood count** is the total point value of all the cards in your hand that are not part of a valid meld.\n\n### 6. Ending a Round\n\nThere are three ways a round can end:\n\n#### 6.1. Going Gin\n\nIf, after drawing a card, you can form melds with all 10 of your cards (leaving you with a deadwood count of zero), you can \"go Gin.\" You would discard your 11th card and declare \"Gin.\"\n\n* **Scoring for Gin:** You receive a bonus of 25 points, plus the total deadwood count of your opponent's hand.\n\n#### 6.2. Knocking\n\nIf your deadwood count is 10 or less after drawing a card, you may choose to \"knock.\" To do this, you discard your 11th card and lay down your hand, separating your melds from your deadwood.\n\n* **Lay-offs:** The opponent then has the opportunity to \"lay off\" any of their own deadwood cards that can be added to your melds. For example, if you have a meld of three Kings, and your opponent has the fourth King, they can lay it off. If you have a run of 5-6-7 of Hearts, they can lay off the 4 of Hearts or the 8 of Hearts.\n* **Scoring for Knocking:**\n    * **If your deadwood count is lower than your opponent's (after they have laid off their cards):** You score the difference between your deadwood and their remaining deadwood.\n    * **Undercutting:** If your opponent, after laying off cards, has a deadwood count that is less than or equal to yours, they have \"undercut\" you. In this case, the opponent scores a 25-point bonus, plus the difference in your deadwood counts.\n\n#### 6.3. Dead Hand\n\nIf the stock pile is reduced to only two cards and no player has knocked or gone Gin, the round is declared a \"dead hand,\" and no points are awarded to either player.\n\n",

        "**Enhanced Prioritize Building Melds Strategy**\nTo refine the strategy, we introduce several enhancements. Firstly, emphasize **Potential Meld Completion** by monitoring cards in the discard pile that could complete or extend melds in hand. Prioritize drawing from the discard pile if a card significantly improves meld potential. Secondly, use **Deadwood Reduction Potential** to evaluate discards\u2014select cards for discard that minimally impact potential melds and maximize deadwood reduction. Thirdly, assess **Knocking Potential** by simulating future turns to estimate reaching a knock position swiftly. Consider knocking over going Gin to secure a scoring advantage early. Lastly, include **Opponent Meld Disruption Potential**\u2014discards should not aid opponent's potential melds based on observed discards. Clarify critical moments: if a card draw completes multiple melds or significantly reduces deadwood, prioritize it. If a discard leaves you one draw away from knocking, prioritize that discard.",
        "**Enhanced Smart Discarding Strategy**\nThe Enhanced Smart Discarding Strategy emphasizes a multi-faceted approach to discarding by integrating specific conditions based on game states. \n\n1. **Critical Moments for Strategic Discards:** \n   - **Opponent Draws from Discard Pile:** If the opponent consistently picks cards of certain suits or values from the discard pile, prioritize discarding cards that do not complement these patterns to prevent helping them complete melds. Time these discards during your turn right after observing such behavior.\n   - **High Deadwood Count:** When your hand has a high deadwood count and few potential melds, favor discarding high-point cards that do not contribute to current or possible future melds.\n\n2. **Condition on Game State Metrics:**\n   - **Potential Meld Completion:** Discard cards that have little potential to be part of a completed or extended meld. This involves calculating the probability of forming melds from the remaining unseen cards based on current hand composition.\n   - **Deadwood Reduction Potential:** Use discards to favorably adjust your deadwood count by getting rid of high-value standalone cards while retaining cards that help form or maintain melds.\n   - **Knocking Potential:** If close to knocking, prioritize discarding cards that do not inch you closer to a deadwood count of 10 or less and retain or draw cards that maximize knock chances.\n   - **Opponent Meld Disruption Potential:** Evaluate historical discard pile behavior and choose discards that diminish the likelihood of supporting the opponent's inferred strategies or preferred card suits/ranks.",
        "**Refined Calculative Drawing Strategy**\n1. Potential Meld Completion: Begin by analyzing the top card in the discard pile for its potential to complete or extend any existing partial melds in your hand. If it fits directly into a set or run, prioritize drawing from the discard pile.\n\n2. Deadwood Reduction Potential: Evaluate if drawing the discard card would reduce your deadwood significantly. Prioritize drawing from the discard pile if it directly contributes to a lower deadwood count. If the card neither completes a meld nor reduces deadwood effectively, consider drawing from the stock pile.\n\n3. Knocking Potential: Examine if taking the card from the discard pile opens a direct pathway to knocking (achieving a deadwood count of 10 or less) either immediately or in the ensuing few moves. Prioritize the discard draw if it presents a high knocking potential.\n\n4. Opponent Meld Disruption Potential: Consider the strategic benefit of drawing from the discard pile to prevent your opponent from utilizing that card to complete their meld. This assessment is made through inferred knowledge of the opponent's strategies based on discard history. If a card is likely beneficial to your opponent and not significantly useful to you, decide on the stock draw.\n\nOverall Decision Making: Throughout each turn, utilize these considerations to inform whether to draw from the stock pile or discard pile, optimizing for meld completion, deadwood minimization, potential knocking, and disrupting opponent strategies effectively.\n\nClarifying 'critical moments': Critical moments refer to turns where the choice between drawing from two sources significantly impacts the metrics outlined (e.g., when a card can complete a meld immediately, or when avoiding giving the opponent an advantageous card is crucial).",
        "**Refined Timely Knocking Strategy**\nThe refined 'Timely Knocking' strategy involves more precise game state considerations to define the 'critical moments' for knocking: \n\n1. **Assess Deadwood Reduction Potential**: Regularly monitor your hand to identify when deadwood reduction leads to a count of 10 or fewer. Consider knocking immediately upon hitting this threshold if:\n   - Your meld completion potential is low for future turns.\n   - The stock pile has many remaining cards, ensuring your opponent cannot benefit from extensive lay-offs.\n\n2. **Evaluate Knocking Potential**: Beyond current deadwood, assess potential future turns where a knock is likely. Opt for moves that maintain flexibility to knock in subsequent turns if immediate knocking isn't viable.\n\n3. **Consider Opponent Meld Disruption Potential**: Choose discards that may hinder your opponent's ability to complete their melds based on insights gathered from past plays. This can limit their scoring if they lay off.\n\n4. **Balance Potential Meld Completion**: Balance your hand by only knocking if further plays do not significantly increase your chance of forming better melds. The potential for completing or extending a meld should weigh against immediate knock, considering the opponent's potential gains and the game's forecasted progression.\n\nBy integrating these considerations, your knocking strategy becomes a tactical decision based on multiple facets of the game, thereby increasing the lead in scoring while effectively countering your opponent's potential plays."
