### 1. Game Objective

The primary goal in Gin Rummy is to form a hand where most or all of your cards are part of valid combinations called **melds**. By doing so, you aim to reduce the value of your unmatched cards, known as **deadwood**, to a minimum. A player can win a round by "going Gin" (having a hand with zero deadwood) or by "knocking" with a low deadwood count.

### 2. Game Setup

* **Players:** The game is designed for two players.
* **Deck:** A standard 52-card deck is used.
* **Dealing:**
    * One player is designated as the dealer.
    * The non-dealer is dealt 11 cards, and the dealer receives 10 cards.
    * The remaining cards form the **stock pile**, which is placed face down. The top card of the stock pile is turned face up to start the **discard pile**.

### 3. Gameplay

The game proceeds in turns, starting with the non-dealer. A player's turn consists of two main actions: a **draw** and a **discard**.

#### 3.1. The Draw

At the beginning of your turn, you must take one card from either:

* The **stock pile** (the face-down deck).
* The **discard pile** (the face-up pile of discarded cards). You may only take the top card of the discard pile.

#### 3.2. The Discard

After drawing a card, you will have 11 cards in your hand. You must then choose one card to discard, placing it face up on top of the discard pile.

### 4. Melds

A **meld** is a combination of cards in your hand that helps to reduce your deadwood score. There are two types of melds:

* **Set:** Three or four cards of the same rank (e.g., 7 of Hearts, 7 of Clubs, 7 of Spades).
* **Run:** Three or more cards of the same suit in sequential order (e.g., 4 of Diamonds, 5 of Diamonds, 6 of Diamonds). Aces are always low in a run (e.g., Ace-2-3 is a valid run, but Queen-King-Ace is not).

A single card cannot belong to more than one meld at the same time.

### 5. Card Values (Deadwood)

The point values of the cards are as follows:

* **Ace:** 1 point
* **Number Cards (2-9):** Face value (e.g., a 5 is worth 5 points)
* **Face Cards (10, Jack, Queen, King):** 10 points each

The **deadwood count** is the total point value of all the cards in your hand that are not part of a valid meld.

### 6. Ending a Round

There are three ways a round can end:

#### 6.1. Going Gin

If, after drawing a card, you can form melds with all 10 of your cards (leaving you with a deadwood count of zero), you can "go Gin." You would discard your 11th card and declare "Gin."

* **Scoring for Gin:** You receive a bonus of 25 points, plus the total deadwood count of your opponent's hand.

#### 6.2. Knocking

If your deadwood count is 10 or less after drawing a card, you may choose to "knock." To do this, you discard your 11th card and lay down your hand, separating your melds from your deadwood.

* **Lay-offs:** The opponent then has the opportunity to "lay off" any of their own deadwood cards that can be added to your melds. For example, if you have a meld of three Kings, and your opponent has the fourth King, they can lay it off. If you have a run of 5-6-7 of Hearts, they can lay off the 4 of Hearts or the 8 of Hearts.
* **Scoring for Knocking:**
    * **If your deadwood count is lower than your opponent's (after they have laid off their cards):** You score the difference between your deadwood and their remaining deadwood.
    * **Undercutting:** If your opponent, after laying off cards, has a deadwood count that is less than or equal to yours, they have "undercut" you. In this case, the opponent scores a 25-point bonus, plus the difference in your deadwood counts.

#### 6.3. Dead Hand

If the stock pile is reduced to only two cards and no player has knocked or gone Gin, the round is declared a "dead hand," and no points are awarded to either player.
