### 1. Card Design

* Uses a **standard 52-card deck** (no jokers).
* **Special card:**

  * All **Eights** are wild. When played, the player must declare a new suit; that becomes the suit for the next play.
* **Card values for scoring:**

  * **8 = 50 points**
  * **10, J, Q, K = 10 points**
  * **A = 1 point**
  * **2–7, 9 = face value**

---

### 2. Dealing

* Works with **2–5 players** (4 is often ideal).
* Each player is dealt **5 cards**.
* The remaining cards form the **stock pile** (face down).
* Turn over the top card to start the **discard pile**.

  * If the first card is an Eight, return it to the bottom of the stock and flip a new starter.
* The suit of the starter card becomes the **current suit**.

---

### 3. Game Round

* Play moves **clockwise**.

* On a player’s turn, they may:

  1. **Play a card**

     * Must match either the **suit** or **rank** of the top discard.
     * An **Eight** can be played at any time; the player then chooses the new suit.

  2. **Draw a card**

     * If unable or unwilling to play, the player draws **one card** from the stock.
     * If that card cannot be played, the turn ends.

  3. **Pass**

     * If the stock is empty and no playable card is available, the player must pass.

* **End of turn:**

  * After playing, the chosen card becomes the new top of the discard pile, and the turn ends.
  * After drawing, if still unable to play, the turn also ends.

* **When the stock runs out:**

  * Play continues with only discards and passes.
  * If all players pass in sequence with no playable moves, the round ends immediately.

---

### 4. Winning

* A round ends when:

  * A player **goes out** by playing their final card, **or**
  * The stock is empty and **no one can play** (stalemate).

* **Scoring:**

  * All opponents total the value of their remaining cards.
  * The winner scores the sum of those points.
  * Each opponent subtracts their own hand’s total from their score.
