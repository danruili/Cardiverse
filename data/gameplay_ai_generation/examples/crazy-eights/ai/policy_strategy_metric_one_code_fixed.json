    "game_description": "### The Pack\n\nThe standard 52-card pack is used.\n\nShop our Hoyle 6 in 1 Fun Pack\n\n### Object of the Game\n\nThe goal is to be the first player to get rid of all the cards in your hand.\n\n### Card Values/scoring\n\nThe player who is the first to have no cards left wins the game. The winning player collects from each other player the value of the cards remaining in that player\u2019s hand as follows:\n\nEach eight = 50 points\n\nEach K, Q, J or 10 = 10 points\n\nEach ace = 1 point\n\nEach other card is the pip value\n\n### The Deal\n\nDeal 5 cards one at a time, face down, beginning with the player to the left. The balance of the pack is placed face down in the center of the table and forms the stock. The dealer turns up the top card and places it in a separate pile; this card is the \u201cstarter.\u201d If an eight is turned, it is buried in the middle of the pack and the next card is turned.\n\nThe Play\n\nStarting to the dealer\u2019s left, each player must place one card face up on the starter pile. Each card played (other than an eight) must match the card showing on the starter pile, either in suit or in denomination.\n\nExample: If the Q of Clubs is the starter, any club may be played on it or any Queen.\n\nIf unable to play, cards are drawn from the top of the stock until a play is possible, or until the stock is exhausted. If unable to play when the stock is exhausted, the player must pass. A player may draw from the stock, even though there may be a playable card in the player\u2019s hand.\n\nAll eights are wild! That is, an eight may be played at any time in turn, and the player need only specify a suit for it (but never a number). The next player must play either a card of the specified suit or an eight.",

        "**Playable Cards Count**\nThe number of cards in the AI player's hand that can be legally played on the current starter pile card. This metric helps to evaluate the current flexibility the player has in terms of their ability to shed cards.\n**Wild Card Usage**\nThe strategic use of eights as wild cards. This metric would consider the situation in which an eight is played and what suit is chosen, aiming to maximize future playability and disrupt opponents' potential moves.\n**Stock Card Draw Potential**\nThe potential impact of drawing cards from the stock pile. This looks at the likelihood of drawing useful cards when the AI player chooses to draw instead of playing a card, potentially improving hand flexibility or preparing for future plays.\n**Opponent Card Count Estimation**\nAn estimation of the number of cards remaining in the opponents' hands, inferred from the game history, especially past plays. This metric helps the AI assess the urgency of its actions, affecting decisions on whether to play conservatively or aggressively.\n**Play High-Value Cards Early**\nFocus on playing your highest-value cards (e.g., eights and face cards) early in the game.\n**Strategic Use of Eights**\nUse eights strategically to disrupt opponents' gameplay and control the game's flow by choosing suits that may hinder them based on observed play history.\n**Maintain Suit Diversity**\nTry to keep a balanced hand with a variety of suits so that you have more playable options regardless of the card turned up on the starter pile.\n**Utilize Drawing Option Wisely**\nSometimes, choose to draw even if you have a playable card, especially if that card is strategically valuable, like a wild eight or low-value card."
