### 1. Card Design

* Uses a **standard 52-card deck** (no jokers).
* Cards track **rank only** (2–A). Suits aren’t used.
* **Objective:** make **books** (sets of four of a kind). There are **13** total possible books.
* **No point values** are used in play; books determine the winner.

---

### 2. Dealing

* Supported players: **2–5** (recommended: **4**).
* **2–3 players** → **7 cards** each
* **4–5 players** → **5 cards** each
* Remaining cards form a **face-down stock pile** in the center.
* There is **no discard pile**.

---

### 3. Game Round

* Play moves **clockwise**. On your turn you may take exactly **one action** . If your request succeeds, you keep the turn.

  1. **Request**

     * Ask a specific **opponent** for a **rank** you **already hold** (e.g., “Do you have any 7s?”).
     * You may **only** ask opponents who **still have cards** in hand.
     * If they have any, they **must** give you **all** of that rank. Your turn **continues**.
     * If they don’t, they say **“Go Fish!”** and you automatically **draw the top card from stock**; your turn **ends**.

  2. **Draw (optional action)**

     * Instead of requesting, you may directly **draw one card** from stock. (This is always legal while stock remains.)
     * After drawing this way, your turn **ends**.

  3. **Reveal Books**

     * Whenever you have **four of a kind** in hand, they become a **book** placed face-up.
     * Revealing is **mandatory and prioritized**: if you already hold a complete book at the start of your turn, you must reveal it before any other action.

* **When stock runs out:**

  * Play continues **without drawing**; you may still **request** as long as at least one player has cards.
  * Turn order **skips** players with empty hands.

---

### 4. Winning

* A round ends when **all 13 books** are made **or** when **every player’s hand is empty**.
* **Winner:** the player(s) with the **most books**.

  * If multiple players tie for most books, the game is a **tie**.
