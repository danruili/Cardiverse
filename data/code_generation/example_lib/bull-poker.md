### 1. Card Design

* Uses a **standard 52-card deck** (no jokers).
* Hands are scored using poker-style rankings (highest to lowest):

  * Five of a kind *(only possible if using wild cards; otherwise skipped)*
  * Straight flush
  * Four of a kind
  * Full house
  * Flush
  * Straight
  * Three of a kind
  * Two pair
  * One pair
  * High card
* Ties are broken by comparing the ranks of the involved cards in descending order (Ace high).

### 2. Dealing

* **Recommended number of players:** 5
* **Allowed range:** 4–7 players
* Each player is dealt **3 facedown cards** (“hole cards”).
* The remaining cards form the **draw pile**.
* Players will gradually receive face-up cards and reveal their hole cards as the game progresses.

---

### 3. Game Round

* Play moves **clockwise**, with each player taking turns.
* On your turn, you choose one of the following actions:

  * **Bet**: place an opening wager (if no bets yet).
  * **Raise**: increase the wager above the current highest bet.
  * **Call**: match the current highest bet.
  * **Fold**: withdraw from the round; your cards are no longer in play.
* After all active players (those who haven’t folded) have acted in a betting cycle:

  1. If players have fewer than 4 face-up cards, each receives **one new face-up card**.
  2. Once all players have 4 face-up cards, players begin to **reveal one of their facedown hole cards** each cycle.
* Betting rounds and card reveals continue until one of the end conditions is reached.

---

### 4. Winning

* A round ends when:

  * Only one player remains (all others have folded), **or**
  * All players’ hole cards have been revealed and the final betting round is complete.
* **Showdown:**

  * Each active player’s face-up cards (plus their revealed hole cards) form their final hand.
  * Hands are compared using the standard ranking order listed above.
  * If one hand outranks the others, that player wins.
  * If two or more hands are tied, the pot is split evenly.
