### 1. Card Design

* Uses a **standard 52-card deck** (no jokers).
* **Trump suit**: Determined at deal time by revealing the **bottom card of the deck** (the card that remains face-down at the very bottom after the initial deal).
* **Trick rank order** (for comparing two cards of the same suit):
  2 (low) < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < J < Q < K < **A** (high).
* **Scoring values (“Game” points)** for cards captured in tricks:

  * 10 = **10 points**
  * A = **4 points**
  * K = **3 points**
  * Q = **2 points**
  * J = **1 point**
  * 2–9 (except 10) = **0 points**
* **Bonus scoring flags** (each worth **1 point** if you captured that exact card in the trump suit):

  * **High** = Ace of trump
  * **Low** = 2 of trump
  * **Jack** = Jack of trump

### 2. Dealing

* **Players**: Exactly **2**.
* **Initial hand**: **6 cards** to each player.
* The **bottom card of the undealt deck** is turned face up and fixed as the **trump card**; its suit is the **trump suit** for the hand.
* The rest of the deck stays face down as the **draw pile**.

### 3. Game Round

Play is **trick-taking**:

1. **Lead & follow**

   * The **current leader** may play **any card**.
   * The other player **must follow suit** if possible.
   * If they cannot follow suit, they **may play a trump**; if they have no trump, they may play **any** card.

2. **Winning the trick**

   * If any trump is played, the **highest trump** wins the trick.
   * If no trump is played, the **highest card of the led suit** wins the trick.
   * The trick winner:

     * **Collects** both cards into their captured pile.
     * Becomes the **leader for the next trick**.

3. **Draw after each trick**

   * After resolving a trick, **if the deck isn’t empty**, **each player draws one card** from the deck (top of deck), keeping hands replenished until the deck runs out.

4. **Hand/round flow**

   * Tricks continue until **both hands are empty** **and** the **deck is empty**.
   * **Scoring is recalculated after every trick**. If someone reaches the win threshold (see Winning), the game ends immediately.

### 4. Winning

* **Scoring each check** (after every trick and at round end):

  * Start with the three trump bonuses you **actually captured**:
    **High (A♣/♦/♥/♠ of trump)** = 1, **Low (2 of trump)** = 1, **Jack (J of trump)** = 1.
  * Add **Game points** from all cards you’ve captured (10=10, A=4, K=3, Q=2, J=1; others 0).
  * Your **current total** = High + Low + Jack + Game points.

* **Ending condition**

  * As soon as any player’s **total ≥ 10**, that player **wins immediately** and the game ends.
