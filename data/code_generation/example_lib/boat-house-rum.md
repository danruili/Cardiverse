### 1. Card Design

* Uses a **standard 52-card deck** (no jokers).
* Card values for scoring:
  * Face cards & 10s = **10 points**
  * A–9 = **5 points** (Ace = 15 if played high)

---

### 2. Dealing

* **2 players** → 10 cards each
* **3-4 players** → 7 cards each
* **5-6 players** → 6 cards each
* Remaining cards form the **stock pile** (face down).
* Turn over the top card to start the **discard pile**.

---

### 3. Game Round

* Play moves **clockwise**. Each turn includes:

  1. **Draw**: Take the top 2 cards from stock or top 2 cards from discard pile.
  2. **Meld or Lay Off**:
     * Meld = 3+ cards of same rank (set) or 3+ cards in sequence of same suit (run).
     * Cards can be added (“laid off”) onto existing melds on the table.
  3. **Discard**: End turn by discarding exactly one card onto the discard pile.

* **Additional Rule:**

  * If the stock runs out:
    * Continue with discard-only play until someone goes out,
    * OR end the hand immediately with unplayed cards counting against players,
    * OR reshuffle the discard pile into a new stock (house rule).

---

### 4. Winning

* A round ends when:

  * A player goes out by melding/laying off all cards and discarding one, **or**
  * The stock pile is depleted (depending on chosen variation).

* **Scoring:**
  * Players score the value of their melds.
  * Subtract the value of cards left in hand.
  * If the player goes out in one turn without prior melding or laying offs, everyone else pay double the score to the winner.
